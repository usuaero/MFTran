Part of the way into the development of this code, we were informed that the name TriPan is already used for a different aerodynamic code. Since we had already published using the name TriPan, this repo remains in existence to direct readers to the new code base. The new pilot code, named MachLine, can be found at [https://github.com/usuaero/MachLine](https://github.com/usuaero/MachLine).

This repo will be archived on 1-10-2022.
